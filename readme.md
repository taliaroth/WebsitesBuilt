Hi!

Here's where I'm posting the websites I've created.

Portfolio Desription:
  I've created a responsive web page using Bootstrap to upload all of my graphic design work. To enhance the user's experience, the pages will adjust to different     screen sizes based on Bootstrap's grid systen. It also includes a hamburger menu for smaller sized screens.

Recipe Search Engine Description:
  Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, many of us have limited access to our usual groceries. Therefor, I created a search engine using Spoonacular’s recipe API’s. This   website allows users to search for the ingredients they want to include, and they’ll have access to a list of recipes that use those ingredients.
