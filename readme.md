Hi!

Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, many of us have limited access to our usual groceries. Therefor, I created a search engine using Spoonacular’s recipe API’s. This website allows users to search for the ingredients they want to include, and they’ll have access to a list of recipes that use those ingredients.

Click on the link for a video on how the search engine runs.
